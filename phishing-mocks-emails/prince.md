Hi,

Good day to you, I am Peter Lorenz, a US soldier currently carrying out my duty in Syria. I have a proposal for you. I and some of my colleagues recovered some huge amounts of money here during the last two weeks during an operation. We just shared the money some days ago and I want to move mine to a safe place. why am I contacting you through this mail because this is the only means of communication I have here.

I came across your email when I was searching for a random person online who I can trust with this proposal. I am willing to offer you 40% of the total money which is $17.8 million USD if you are willing to do the deal with me and I also want you to know that this is very legit
Here is my personal email address: (peter.lorenz0389383@gmail.com) you can reply me here if you are willing to do this deal with me and I will advise you ahead on how I will send the funds out to you.

You are to ignore this mail if you are not interested.

I will wait for your response.
Best Regards,
Peter
